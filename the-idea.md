Soooooo ...
I have that crazy idea! for a game OFC!

A charachter with a cool shotgun, mining for diamonds.
He got his first one, and he's trying to reach the end of that cave, in his way he find the weirdest creatures he ever seen!
Like a Cookie cat!

And "they" try their best to steal any of his diamonds.
Well, we can add more ores, but the less ores rarity he get, The more creatures will steal if they catch him.

So basicly this is my Woahwo idea, nothing more.
Future me, I know how much you LOVE javascript, BUT I suggest that you don't do that shit in javascript.
